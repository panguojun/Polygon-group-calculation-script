# Polygon-group-calculation-script
Many difficult mathematics and physics problems in history have been solved by introducing group theory. Group theory can be used to find the simple symmetry behind complex phenomena.
This project attempts to use scripting language to realize the additive group operation of three-dimensional polygons, and tries to simplify the morphological structure.
